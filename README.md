🌱 I’m currently learning web development

## What I am currently working on:

I am hoping to change career paths, and become a full time developer. To help me with this, I have decided to try and create my own UI components for use in my website. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/Kvanrooyen/tranquilo-css), any suggestions would be great.
